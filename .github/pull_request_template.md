## Checklist
- [ ] I have verified that these changes work locally on the following warehouses (Note: it's okay if you do not have access to all warehouses, this helps us understand what has been covered):
    - [ ] Postgres
    - [ ] BigQuery
    - [ ] Snowflake
    - [ ] Redshift
- [ ] I have written tests for new macros (either as dbt schema tests in `integration_tests/models`, dbt data tests in `integration_tests/tests` or integration tests in the [CI workflow](workflows/main.yml))
- [ ] I have updated the README.md (if applicable)
